# Audio Picker

A special-purpose button. When the user taps an audio picker, the device's audio gallery appears, and the user can choose an audio file. After an audio file is picked, it is saved, and the `Selected` property will be the name of the file where the audio file is stored. In order to not fill up storage, a maximum of 10 audio files will be stored.  Picking more audio files will delete previous audio files, in order from oldest to newest.
