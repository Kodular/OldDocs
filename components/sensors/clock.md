# Clock

Non-visible component that provides the instant in time using the internal clock on the phone.It can fire a timer at regularly set intervals and perform time calculations, manipulations, and conversions.

Methods to convert an instant to text are also available. Acceptable patterns are empty string, MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:ss a, or MMM d, yyyy HH:mm. The empty string will provide the default format, which is "MMM d, yyyy HH:mm:ss a" for FormatDateTime, "MMM d, yyyy" for FormatDate. To see all possible format, please see here.

Date and Time are formatted with InstantInTime and Duration.

Instant : consists of Year, Month, DayOfMonth, Hour, Minute, and Second. An instant can be created by using MakeInstant method.

Duration : time in milliseconds elapsed between instants. Duration can be obtained by Duration method.
