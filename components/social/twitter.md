* Sending a Tweet with an Image (TweetWithImage)
* Directing a message to a specific user (DirectMessage)
* Receiving the most recent messages directed to the logged-in user (RequestDirectMessages)
* Following a specific user (Follow)
* Ceasing to follow a specific user (StopFollowing)
* Getting a list of users following the logged-in user (RequestFollowers)
* Getting the most recent messages of users followed by the logged-in user (RequestFriendTimeline)
* Getting the most recent mentions of the logged-in user (RequestMentions)

You must obtain a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret for Twitter authorization specific to your app from http://twitter.com/oauth_clients/new
