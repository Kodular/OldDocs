It can be quite a hassle building and installing your project's APK file on your device whenever you make a change. Makeroid has one feature that makes the process of designing your apps much easier - the Makeroid companion. The companion can be installed on your device just like any normal Android app. Once you've connected the companion to the builder, either by WiFI or USB, the changes you make in the designer, will be instantly displayed on your device.

## How to use the Companion
### Preparation on Makeroid Builder

**Step 1:** From the App Bar, choose "Test".
