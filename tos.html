            <ul style="disc">
              <li>In order to debug and improve the Makeroid Builder system.</li>

These service providers and contractors will be obligated to keep your information confidential.</li>

If you delete an app, there is the possibility that Makeroid may be able to continue to access it from the backups we keep for purposes of system maintenance, but these backups are periodically purged and are not designed for long-term preservation. Makeroid will strive to keep your apps and your account accessible to you for as long as you wish, but we have no obligation to do so, and Makeroid has no liability for the consequences of the service becoming unavailable or your apps becoming unavailable.
